# Seven-Eleven-Game
A game is played where the player rolls two dice. If the sum of the dice is neither seven nor eleven, the player is awarded a number of points equal to the larger of the two values rolled. The player has up to 10 rolls to accumulate points; however, if the sum is either seven or eleven, the player loses all his/her points.
